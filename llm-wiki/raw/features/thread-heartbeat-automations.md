# Thread heartbeat automations source notes

Captured: 2026-05-09

## Scope

Thread heartbeat automations are local Codex automation records stored under `$CODEX_HOME/automations/<automation-id>/automation.toml`. Each record can attach to a chat thread through `target_thread_id`.

## Multiple automations per thread

The thread automation bridge supports multiple heartbeat automations with the same `target_thread_id`. Backend listing returns a map from thread id to an ordered automation array. Individual automation edit and delete operations use both `threadId` and `automationId`, so removing one automation does not remove the other automations attached to that thread.

The sidebar thread menu shows `Manage automations...` when at least one automation exists. The manager lists existing automations, lets the user select one for editing, and includes `Add another automation` to create an additional automation for the same thread.

## Manual run

The automation manager includes `Run now` for saved automations. The run endpoint validates the `threadId` and `automationId`, appends a Codex.app-style heartbeat payload as a default-mode queued message for the target thread, and schedules the backend queue processor immediately.

Manual run heartbeat payloads include `automation_id`, `current_time_iso`, and `instructions`, matching the fields Codex.app requires for heartbeat user-message parsing. Incomplete heartbeat payloads must be treated as normal text so malformed internal XML does not get mislabeled as an automation run.

Manual runs use the persisted thread queue rather than directly interrupting or steering a turn. If the target thread is idle, the queue can start the automation turn immediately. If the thread is already running, the automation waits in queue order until the thread is available.

Heartbeat user messages render as visible user-side automation prompt cards labeled `Sent via automation`. The renderer shows the parsed `instructions` text and never shows the raw heartbeat XML for valid payloads.

## Verification expectations

Manual verification should cover light and dark themes, multiple automations on one thread, selecting and editing each automation independently, `Run now` while idle, `Run now` while another turn is active, visible automation prompt cards in selected threads, and cleanup of all test automations.
